# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Repository**! This repo is a comprehensive collection of **classic software design patterns**, implemented with clear, easy-to-understand examples. It's designed to help developers of all levels **learn, practice, and apply design patterns** in real-world projects.

## 📚 What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **reusable solutions to common software design problems**. They help you write code that is:

* **Maintainable** – easier to update and modify
* **Scalable** – easier to expand functionality
* **Reusable** – general solutions that can be applied across projects
* **Readable** – improves clarity for you and other developers

This repo follows the **Gang of Four (GoF) classification**:

1. **Creational Patterns** – deal with object creation mechanisms
2. **Structural Patterns** – deal with object composition and relationships
3. **Behavioral Patterns** – deal with object interactions and responsibilities

## 🗂 Repository Structure

```
design-patterns/
│
├─ Creational Patterns/     # Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, etc.
├─ Structural Patterns/     # Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite, etc.
├─ Behavioral Patterns/     # Observer, Strategy, Command, State, etc.
├─ README.md                # This file
```

Each pattern folder contains:

* A **code example** showing the pattern in action
* A **README.md** explaining:
  * Problem
  * Bad Code Example
  * Good Code Example

## 🔹 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by category**: Start with Creational, Structural, or Behavioral patterns.
2. **Read the pattern README**: Understand the problem, solution, and real-world examples.
3. **Experiment**: Modify the examples or combine patterns in mini-projects to reinforce learning.
