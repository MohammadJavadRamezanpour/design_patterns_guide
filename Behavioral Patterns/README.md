# Behavioral Design Patterns

Welcome to the **Behavioral Design Patterns** folder! This folder contains examples of patterns that show **how objects interact and communicate** in a program.

## 📚 What are Behavioral Patterns?

Behavioral patterns help you:

* Organize how objects work together
* Make your code easier to understand and maintain
* Change behavior without modifying existing code

Some examples included here:

* **Observer** – Notify many objects when something changes
* **Strategy** – Choose algorithms at runtime
* **Command** – Encapsulate actions as objects
* **State** – Change object behavior based on state
* **Template Method** – Define steps of an algorithm with some parts customizable
* **Iterator** – Go through items in a collection easily
* **Mediator** – Make objects communicate through a central point
* **Memento** – Save and restore object state
* **Visitor** – Perform operations on objects without changing them
* **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass requests along a chain of objects
* **Interpreter** – Evaluate simple expressions or commands

## 🗂 How the Folder is Organized

Each pattern has its own folder:

* A Python file with example code (e.g., `Strategy.py`)
* A `README.md` explaining the pattern in simple terms

Example:

```
Behavioral Patterns/
├─ Strategy Pattern/
│   └─ README.md
├─ Observer Pattern/
│   └─ README.md
├─ State Pattern/
│   └─ README.md
```

## 🔹 How to Use

1. Pick a pattern folder you want to learn.
2. Read the README.md to understand the idea.
3. Try changing the code to see how it works.

**Tip:** Start with simple patterns like Strategy or Observer before moving to more complex ones. Practice is the best way to learn!

Happy coding! 🚀
