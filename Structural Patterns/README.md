# Structural Design Patterns

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Structural Design Patterns**. Structural patterns focus on **how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures**, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable software.

## 📚 What are Structural Patterns?

Structural patterns deal with **object composition and relationships**. They help you ensure that your system's structure is flexible and efficient while promoting **reusability**. These patterns simplify the design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between entities.

The main structural patterns included in this folder are:

1. **Adapter** – Converts one interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
2. **Bridge** – Separates an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
3. **Composite** – Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
4. **Decorator** – Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying the original class.
5. **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
6. **Flyweight** – Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
7. **Proxy** – Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, or defer operations.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

Each structural pattern has its own folder with:

* `pattern_name.py` – Example implementation
* `README.md` – Detailed explanation, use cases, and pros/cons

Example structure:

```

├─ Adapter Pattern/
│   └─ README.md
├─ Bridge Pattern/
│   └─ README.md
├─ Composite Pattern/

## 🔹 How to Use This Folder

1. Choose a structural pattern you want to study.
2. Open the pattern folder and read the `README.md` for an overview.
3. Experiment by modifying the code or combining patterns in a mini-project.

## 💡 Tips

* Look for patterns that simplify relationships between objects.
* Notice how each pattern helps reduce complexity and improve code maintainability.
* Try applying multiple structural patterns together in small projects to reinforce learning.
